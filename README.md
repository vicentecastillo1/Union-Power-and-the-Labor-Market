This project was developed as part of my undergraduate coursework in May 2024. Its main objective was to study the impact of the 2016 labor reform in Chile, which significantly strengthened the bargaining power of trade unions, on workers’ labor market outcomes. In particular, the project focused on analyzing how the reform affected wages and the probability of remaining employed for individuals working in firms with union presence.
